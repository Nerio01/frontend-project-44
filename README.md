### BRAIN GAMES

This is my first project on hexlet javascript course. 

This project consists of 5 math games for users to hone their math chops (although very basic ones).

To run this project you need: 

1) Anything that can at least run any OS like Linux, Windown or MacOS.
2) node js installed?
