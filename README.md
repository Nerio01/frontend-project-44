## BRAIN GAMES

This is my first project on hexlet javascript course. 

This project consists of 5 math games for users to hone their math chops.

*To run this project you need:* 

1) Anything that can at least run a conventional OS like Linux, Windows or MacOS.
2) Node JS installed. You can download it from the official Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) and follow the installation instructions based on your operating system.
3) From project folder open console and run command `make install`.
4) Then run command `npx link` 
5) Now you can start CLI games by typing one of the following in console:
- `brain-calc`
- `brain-even`
- `brain-gcd`
- `brain-progression`
- `brain-prime`
6) Go ahead and try it out!

***Below are examples of each game for your reference:***
